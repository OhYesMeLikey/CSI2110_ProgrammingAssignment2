Include files: README.txt, Constants.java, Logic.java, ProgrammingA2Q1.java, ProgrammingA2Q2.java, ProgrammingA2Q3.java, q3test.txt, and Task 1 Part C.pdf

Student comments:
Please compile ALL of the java files in the given folder before running them.

When you run the file ProgrammingA2Q1.java, put either "a" or "A" in the command arguments to test for Task 1 Part A, or 
put either "b" or "B" in the command arguments to test for Task 1 Part B. Just follow the instructions after putting in "a", "A", "b", or "B".
E.g. java ProgrammingA2Q1 "a" or java ProgrammingA2Q1 "b".

To check my solution for Task 1 Part C, go to the given pdf called "Task 1 Part C.pdf".

When you run the file ProgrammingA2Q2.java, enclose the message or text that has to be tested in quotes in the command arguments. 
E.g. java ProgrammingA2Q2 "data structure is fun"

Before you run the file ProgrammingA2Q3.java, erase all of the contents in q3test.txt, and type in the sentences that will be tested in that text file. 
Save the text file, and run the command (without the quotes) "java ProgrammingA2Q3 q3test.txt" as the java file will read the contents from that text 
file and produce a hash result.
